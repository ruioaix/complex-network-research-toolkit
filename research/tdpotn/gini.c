/**
 * default: ./tdpotn-base 50 1 1 5 1.0 0
 * N = 50, for 1d ring, it's the idNum. for 2d lattice, it's the height&width of lattice; for example, if N = 50, the nodes of lattice is 2500.
 * seed = 1, it's the seed for PRNG.
 * D_12 = 1, 1 means 1d, 2 means 2d.
 * limitN = 5, the constrain for this research, C = limitN * nodeNum.
 * theta = 1.0, it will change air. to geit will change air. to guarantee we can generate air successful, theta >= 0.5.
 * 	theta decide the cost of building a new edges in air, if theta < 1, the cost of long edges is not so much, 
 * 	else the cost of long edges is much more expensive than short.
 * lambda = 1, this decide the effect of a air edge. 
 * 	if lambda = 0, all air edges's weight is 1, it's the best experience.
 * 	if lambda = 1, all air edges has no advance to base net. it's the worst experience.
 * 	lambda affect the the value of airlf->d1, and in the program, airlf->d1 is not used. so it's not important for base.c.
