/*
 * there are a lot of options, some optins may seem important and should not be only an option.
 * the reason I put them in options is :
 * 		may be not existed by default.
 * 		may be memory-greedy 
 * 		may be time-greedy(computing-complex)
 * 		may be difficult to maintain when modifying the net.
 * and they will not used by me frequently.
 *
 * if net is directed, 
 * 		diffence between degree&indegree, edges&inedges, weight&inweight is obvious.
 * if net is undirected,
 * 		degree == indegree, edges == inedges, weight == inweight.
 *
 * when net is undirected, each edge is stored twice, but edges&inedges point to the same address.
 * 		an edge between 34 and 22, there are edges[34][x] = 22 and edges[22][y] = 34. 
 * 		but inedges is point to the same memory block of edges.
 *
 * when net is directed, each edge is stored only once in edges, and  stored another time in inedges.
 * 		an edge frome 34 to 22, there is edges[34][x] = 22, but edges[22][y] = 34 maybe not existed.
 * 		but inedge[22][z] = 34 must be existed.
 *
 * so actually, the memory consumed by directed net is not quite different from that by undirected net.
