/*
 * there are a lot of options, some optins may seem important and should not be only an option.
 * the reason I put them in options is :
 * 		may be not existed by default.
 * 		may be memory-greedy 
 * 		may be time-greedy(computing-complex)
 * 		may be difficult to maintain when modifying the net.
 * 		or they will not used by me frequently.
 *
 * if net is directed, 
 * 		diffence between degree&indegree, edges&inedges, weight&inweight is obvious.
 * if net is undirected,
 * 		NULL == indegree == inedges == inweight.
 *
 * when net is undirected, each edge is stored twice.
 * 		an edge between 34 and 22, there are edges[34][x] = 22 and edges[22][y] = 34. 
 *
 * when net is directed, each edge is stored only once in edges, and  stored another time in inedges.
 * 		an edge frome 34 to 22, there is edges[34][x] = 22, but edges[22][y] = 34 maybe not existed(depends on whether there is an edge from 22 to 34.
 * 		but inedge[22][z] = 34 is existed.
 *
 * if weight != NULL, then the Net is weighted.
 * if weight == NULL, then the Net is unweighted.
 * it's quite clear, so I don't need to set a weightStatus.
 * but this is not suit for directStatus.
 * because even in a directed net, edges element can store all the informations.
 * so inedges element is not essential, thus I can not check the value of inedges to decide whether the net is directed or not.
